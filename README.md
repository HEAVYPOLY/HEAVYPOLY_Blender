2. Copy the folders named `config` and `scripts` into:  
   ```
   C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.3\
   ```
   > ⚠️ Replace `4.3` with your actual Blender version.  
   > ⚠️ The `AppData` folder is hidden. Enable **"Show hidden files"** in your File Explorer settings to see it.
